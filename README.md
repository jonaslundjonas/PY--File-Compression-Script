File Compression Script
Written by Jonas Lund 2024

Description:
    This script compresses all files in the current folder into a zip file,
    excluding the script itself. The user will be prompted to enter a name
    for the zip file.

Setup:
    1. Place this script in the folder containing the files you want to compress
    2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system

How to run:
    1. Open a terminal/command prompt
    2. Navigate to the folder containing this script
    3. Run the script using: python script_name.py
    4. Enter a name for the zip file when prompted (don't include .zip extension)

What to expect:
    - The script will create a zip file with your chosen name
    - It will show progress as each file is added to the archive
    - At the end, it will display the total number of files compressed
    - The script itself will not be included in the zip file
